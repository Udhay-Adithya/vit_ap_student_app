### 2. **Account Login**
   The App uses VTOP credentials provided by VIT-AP University to authenticate users. You cannot create or modify your login credentials within the App. Any changes to your VTOP credentials must be made directly through VTOP, not through the App.

   **Important**: You must not share your VTOP credentials with anyone. If your account is compromised due to sharing credentials or unauthorised access, you are solely responsible for any consequences.

### 3. **Data Collection and Use**
   - The App uses Firebase Analytics to collect anonymized usage data including:
     - Screen navigation patterns
     - Interaction events
     - Aggregated user group information (joining year and branch)
   - Your full registration number is never collected or stored. Only derived properties (first 5 characters) are used for grouping in analytics.
   - By using the App, you agree to Google's [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) for Firebase.
   
   **Important**: Your VTOP credentials are stored locally in encrypted form, and the App fetches academic data from the VTOP portal. The developer is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the academic data fetched from VTOP.

### 4. **Data Scraping Consent**
   By using this App, you explicitly agree that your academic data will be scraped from the VTOP Portal for the purpose of displaying it in the App. The developer of the App acts solely as a service provider and is not responsible for any legal issues related to scraping data from the VTOP Portal. It is the user's responsibility to ensure their consent to this process by using the App.

### 5. **Limitation of Liability**
   - The App displays academic data fetched from the VTOP Portal. The developer is not responsible for any inaccuracies or unavailability of the data on VTOP. For any issues with the data, users must contact the **Software Development Cell of VIT-AP University**.
   - In the event of technical issues or bugs, users can report them using the in-app report feature.
   - If the VTOP portal is unavailable, the App will display locally stored data, but no new data can be fetched until VTOP is operational again.

### 6. **Changes to Terms and Conditions**
   The developer reserves the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Any changes will be communicated to users via an in-app notification. Continued use of the App after such updates constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.

### 7. **Termination of Access**
   The developer reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to the App for users who violate these Terms.

### 8. **Governing Law**
   These Terms are governed by the laws of the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. Any legal disputes arising from the use of the App will be resolved under Indian jurisdiction.
