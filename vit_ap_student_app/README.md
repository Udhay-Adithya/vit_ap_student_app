# vit_ap_student_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


Page files (e.g., login_page.dart, home_page.dart, etc.): Each page file should contain the UI logic and layout for the respective page. You can also include the business logic related to that page within the same file or separate it into another file if it becomes too large.

Models: Define data models in separate files within the models folder. These models represent the structure of your data and can be used throughout your app.

Services: Keep services such as authentication, data fetching, and other backend interactions in separate files within the services folder. This helps in separating concerns and maintaining a clean codebase.

Utils: Place utility functions or classes that are used across your app in the utils folder. This can include constants, validators, formatters, or any other utility functions.
